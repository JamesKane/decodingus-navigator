## Features Remaining to Develop

### Priority 1: Complete In-Development Features

#### Ancestry Estimation (populationBreakdown)
**What it does:** Estimates population percentages using PCA projection against 1000 Genomes + HGDP/SGDP reference panels. Supports quick AIMs panel (~5k SNPs, 2-5 min) and detailed genome-wide analysis (~500k SNPs, 20-30 min).

**Remaining work:**
- Prepare reference data: Pre-compute PCA loadings and population centroids from reference panel
- Package reference data for download (~15MB AIMs, ~250MB genome-wide)
- Implement `AncestryReferenceGateway` for reference data download/caching
- Wire up UI in WorkbenchView for triggering analysis
- Generate HTML/JSON reports with pie charts and confidence intervals

**Files:** `src/main/scala/com/decodingus/ancestry/`

#### Chip Data Processing (genotype)
**What it does:** Parses raw genotype exports from consumer testing companies (23andMe, AncestryDNA, FTDNA, MyHeritage, LivingDNA). Extracts Y-DNA and mtDNA markers for haplogroup estimation.

**Remaining work:**
- Complete haplogroup estimation from chip Y-DNA/mtDNA markers
- Wire up ancestry analysis integration (chip → populationBreakdown)
- UI for chip file import and results display
- Workspace persistence for ChipProfile records

**Files:** `src/main/scala/com/decodingus/genotype/`

### Priority 2: Network Integration

#### Granular Record Sync
**What it does:** Syncs individual records (biosample, sequenceRun, alignment, etc.) to PDS instead of monolithic workspace sync. Enables fine-grained updates and reduced data transfer.

**Remaining work:**
- Implement per-record createRecord/putRecord/deleteRecord calls
- Track sync status per record (local-only, synced, pending)
- Handle conflict resolution when local and remote diverge
- Add SyncStatus model to workspace

#### Firehose Publishing
**What it does:** Publishes record changes to AT Protocol firehose for AppView consumption. Enables real-time network-wide features like branch discovery consensus.

**Remaining work:**
- Implement firehose event generation on record changes
- Define event payload schemas
- Add opt-in consent flow for network participation

---

### Priority 3: IBD Matching System

#### Match Consent (matchConsent)
**What it does:** Opt-in record for IBD matching participation. Controls what data is shared and matching thresholds.

**Remaining work:**
- Define consent UI with granular privacy controls
- Implement matchConsent record creation/management
- Integrate with ancestry analysis for population context

#### Match Discovery (matchList)
**What it does:** Stores potential IBD matches discovered by AppView. User explores matches locally before confirmation.

**Remaining work:**
- Implement matchList record consumption from AppView
- Build match explorer UI with segment visualization
- Calculate relationship estimates from shared cM

#### Match Confirmation (matchRequest, confirmedMatch)
**What it does:** Two-way handshake for confirming matches. Both parties must agree before contact info exchange.

**Remaining work:**
- Implement matchRequest creation and response flow
- Build confirmedMatch stamping when both agree
- Notification system for incoming match requests

---

### Priority 4: Multi-Run Reconciliation

#### Haplogroup Reconciliation (haplogroupReconciliation)
**What it does:** Reconciles haplogroup calls across multiple sequence runs (e.g., Big Y + WGS + chip). Identifies conflicts, resolves discrepancies, verifies sample identity.

**Remaining work:**
- Implement reconciliation algorithm comparing calls across runs
- Detect SNP conflicts and heteroplasmy observations
- Identity verification via autosomal concordance
- Build reconciliation report UI
- Integrate with existing haplogroup analysis pipeline

---

### Priority 5: AppView Backfeed

#### Haplogroup Update Notifications (haplogroupUpdate)
**What it does:** AppView notifies user when haplogroup assignment is refined based on new tree version or network consensus.

**Remaining work:**
- Subscribe to haplogroupUpdate records from AppView
- Display notifications in UI
- Optionally trigger re-analysis with updated tree

#### Branch Discovery (branchDiscovery)
**What it does:** AppView notifies when user's private variants contributed to new branch discovery.

**Remaining work:**
- Subscribe to branchDiscovery records
- Display discovery notifications with attribution
- Link to updated tree showing new branch

#### Tree Version Updates (treeVersionUpdate)
**What it does:** AppView notifies when haplogroup tree is updated.

**Remaining work:**
- Subscribe to treeVersionUpdate records
- Prompt user to re-run haplogroup analysis
- Show changelog of tree updates

---

### Priority 6: Future Capabilities

#### Imputation (imputation)
**What it does:** Imputes missing genotypes from chip data using reference panels. Enables ancestry analysis on sparse chip data.

**Scope:** Significant infrastructure - may require external imputation service or local Minimac4 integration.

#### Instrument Observation (instrumentObservation)
**What it does:** Crowdsourced sequencer/lab discovery. Users report instrument IDs and lab names to build community database.

**Scope:** Requires AppView aggregation logic and curator workflow.

#### Ancestral STR Reconstruction (haplogroupAncestralStr)
**What it does:** Reconstructs ancestral STR states at haplogroup branch points using network-wide STR profiles.

**Scope:** Requires significant network data aggregation. AppView feature primarily.
