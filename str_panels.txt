Y-STR Results Guide

At FamilyTreeDNA, we test up to 838 Y-chromosome DNA short tandem repeat (STR) markers in our Y-STR tests. Below is a list of all markers offered in these panels.

The following are descriptions of special characters that you might see on your results page:

¤ This result is new since your last sign in.
* A value of “0” for any marker indicates that the lab reported a null value for this marker. Our labs retest all cases of null values multiple times to confirm their accuracy. Mutations causing null values are infrequent, but fathers pass on null values to their sons just like other Y-DNA mutations. Therefore, related male lineages such as a father and a son are likely to share null values.
** DYS19 is also known as DYS394.
*** The FamilyTreeDNA and the Genographic Project report DYS389II differently.
– For Panel 6 (112-561) and Panel 7 (562-838) Y-STR results, a – is displayed when you have a “no call” result for an STR. A “no call” result means that we do not have enough information for that STR to confirm a value
For the Big Y Panels 6 and 7 (112-838) STRs, please note that although we test 727 STRs for these panels, we only guarantee results for at least 589 of these STRs.

Y-STR Panels Each panel includes the following:

Marker - Specific STR tested. Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) determine your Y-DNA signature in order to predict your haplogroup and match you to other testers.
Value - Determined repeat count for the specific Short Tandem Repeat marker in your Y chromosome. Some markers have multiple copies and values (alleles).
The first row is the locus number in the test panel. For example, for the first panel (Y-12 results) each locus is numbered 1 through 12.
The second row is the scientific name of each STR tested. Everyone who tests, respective to the Y-12, 25, 37, 67, or 111 marker tests, is tested for the same STR markers at the same loci.
The third row contains the allele values for each STR. These are the values that make up your DNA signature.

Micro Alleles
Some STR markers might have a partial repeat reported here. Micro alleles are normalized before matching.

Marker - Specific STR tested. Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) determine your Y-DNA signature in order to predict your haplogroup and match you to other testers
Result - Determined repeat count for the specific Short Tandem Repeat marker in your Y chromosome, including the number of bases in the partial repeat.
Normalized Result - Normalized (rounded) repeat count for the specific Short Tandem Repeat marker in your Y chromosome, which is the value used for matching.
